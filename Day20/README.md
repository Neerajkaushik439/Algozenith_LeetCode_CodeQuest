 the goal is to add one to the number represented as an array of digits. Start from the last digit and handle the addition. If a digit becomes 10, set it to 0 and carry over the 1 to the next significant digit. Repeat this process until no carry remains. If all digits are 9 (e.g., `[9, 9, 9]`), a new array with an extra leading `1` is created to handle the carry. This approach avoids converting the array into a number directly, making it efficient and free from data type limitations.
