The solution uses backtracking to generate all possible permutations of the string by exploring each character's two states: unchanged or toggled (for alphabetic characters). Starting from the first character, the algorithm recursively toggles cases (if applicable) and moves to the next character until the end of the string is reached, adding each valid permutation to the result list. Non-alphabetic characters are skipped, and the recursion ensures all combinations are explored.
