 Create a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of unique paths to cell `(i, j)`. Initialize the first row and column with 1, as thereâ€™s only one way to reach any cell in these rows/columns. For other cells, calculate `dp[i][j]` as the sum of paths from the top (`dp[i-1][j]`) and left (`dp[i][j-1]`). The result will be stored in `dp[m-1][n-1]`, where `m` and `n` are the dimensions of the grid.
