The approach involves iterating through the list of target values and, for each target, finding two consecutive integers \( x \) and \( y \) (where \( y = x + 1 \)) such that their bitwise OR equals the target. Starting from \( x = 0 \), the algorithm checks all possible values of \( x \) up to the target, and if a valid \( x \) is found, it is stored as the result for that target. If no such \( x \) exists, the result for that target is set to \(-1\). This process is repeated for each element in the list.
