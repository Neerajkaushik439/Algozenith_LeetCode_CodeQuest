The solution starts at the initial position `(0, 0)` and recursively checks for a valid knight's tour by following the sequence of numbers in the grid. For each number, it searches the entire grid for the next number (`num + 1`) and validates whether moving to that cell is a valid knight's move (using predefined conditions for all 8 possible moves). If a valid move is found, the function proceeds to the next step; otherwise, it backtracks. The base case occurs when the last number (`n * n - 1`) is reached, confirming a valid tour.
