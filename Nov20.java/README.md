To solve the problem of finding the single number in an array where every element appears twice except one, we use the XOR (exclusive OR) operation. XOR has unique properties: any number XORed with itself results in 0 (`x ^ x = 0`), and any number XORed with 0 remains unchanged (`x ^ 0 = x`). By iterating through the array and XORing all the elements, the duplicates effectively cancel each other out, leaving only the number that appears once. This approach ensures a time complexity of **O(n)** for traversing the array and uses constant space (**O(1)**), making it both efficient and elegant.
