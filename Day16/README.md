The problem can be solved using recursion. The function `countAndSay(n)` generates the sequence by recursively calling `countAndSay(n-1)` to get the previous sequence and then constructing the current sequence by counting consecutive characters in the previous sequence. Each group of consecutive identical characters is replaced with the count followed by the character itself. This process continues until the base case `n = 1`, where the sequence is simply "1".
