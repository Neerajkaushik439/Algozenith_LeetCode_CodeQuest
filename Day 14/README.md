The 3Sum problem is solved using a combination of sorting and the two-pointer technique. First, sort the array to simplify duplicate handling and allow efficient pair searching. For each element in the array, fix it as the first number and use two pointers to find two other numbers that sum up to the negative of the fixed number, ensuring duplicates are avoided by skipping repeated values during traversal. This approach reduces the complexity to \(O(n^2)\) while maintaining correctness.
