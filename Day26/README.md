 The approach uses **dynamic programming** with a 2D table `dp[i][j]` where `dp[i][j]` is `true` if the first `i` characters of the string match the first `j` characters of the pattern. Key cases include handling `.` as a match-all for single characters, and `*` for matching zero occurrences (`dp[i][j-2]`) or multiple occurrences (`dp[i-1][j]`). The base case involves initializing matches for empty strings and patterns.
