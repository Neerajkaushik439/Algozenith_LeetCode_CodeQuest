To solve the problem, we use a sliding window technique with a hash map. First, we create a frequency map of the given words. Then, for every possible starting position (up to the length of one word), we iterate through the string with a sliding window equal to the total length of the concatenated words. For each window, we check if the substring contains the words in the required frequency using a second hash map. If valid, we store the starting index.
