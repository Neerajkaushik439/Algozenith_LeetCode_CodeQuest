The solution involves two pointers: one (`left`) to track the position where nodes smaller than `x` should be inserted, and another (`right`) to traverse the list. As `right` iterates through the list, nodes with values less than `x` are extracted and inserted after `left`, maintaining their original order. A dummy node is used to simplify edge cases, and the two partitions are linked at the end to return the modified list.
