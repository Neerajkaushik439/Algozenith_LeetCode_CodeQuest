To convert an integer to a Roman numeral, we first initialize two arrays: one for the Roman numeral symbols and another for their corresponding integer values, ordered from largest to smallest. Then, we iterate through the values array, and for each value, we append the corresponding Roman numeral symbol to the result string while subtracting the value from the given number as long as the number is greater than or equal to the current value. This process continues until the entire number has been reduced to zero, and the final Roman numeral string is returned, constructed using a StringBuilder to efficiently handle string concatenation.
