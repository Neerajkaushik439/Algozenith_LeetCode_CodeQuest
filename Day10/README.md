The **Four Sum** problem involves finding all unique quadruplets in an array that sum to a given target. The approach starts by sorting the array to simplify handling duplicates and using a two-pointer technique. For each pair of outer loops (`i` and `j`), representing the first two numbers, the remaining two numbers are identified using left and right pointers (`left` and `right`). By comparing their sum with the target, the pointers are adjusted to find valid quadruplets, while avoiding duplicates by skipping over repeated numbers.
