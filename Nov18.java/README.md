The problem involves decrypting a circular array by replacing each element with the sum of the next or previous \( k \) elements based on the value of \( k \). For \( k > 0 \), the sum is calculated by adding the next \( k \) elements, wrapping around the array using modular arithmetic. For \( k < 0 \), the sum is calculated by adding the previous \(|k|\) elements, similarly wrapping indices. If \( k = 0 \), all elements are replaced with 0.
