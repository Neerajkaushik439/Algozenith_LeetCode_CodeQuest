To solve Pascal's Triangle, start by initializing the first row with a single element `[1]`. For each subsequent row, begin with `1`, then compute the intermediate elements by summing adjacent elements from the previous row, and end the row with `1`. Repeat this process until the desired number of rows is generated. Store each row in a list, and return the list of all rows as the final Pascal's Triangle.
