The solution counts the number of "good partitions" by dynamically managing the frequencies of elements in the array. Using a `Map`, it tracks the count of each element, while a `Set` stores pairs of frequencies (negated for efficient ordering) and elements to identify when all elements in the current subset are used up. As the array is traversed, frequencies are updated, and whenever the `Set` becomes empty, it signifies a valid partition, incrementing the partition count. Finally, the result is calculated as \(2^{(count-1)} \mod 10^9+7\) using binary exponentiation for efficiency. This approach efficiently handles partition tracking and large results through modular arithmetic.
