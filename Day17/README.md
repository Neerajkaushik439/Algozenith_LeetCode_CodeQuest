To solve the permutation problem, we use a **backtracking approach**. Starting with an empty list, we recursively build permutations by adding each unused number to the current list, marking it as visited. When the current list reaches the length of the input array, it is added to the result. After exploring each path, we backtrack by unmarking the number as visited and removing it from the list to explore other possibilities.
